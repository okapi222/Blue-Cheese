# Example and Test Files Go in `examples/`

## Critical Rule
When creating files to **test, demonstrate, or experiment with** a skill or component, always place them in the `examples/` folder — never in `src/`.

## When This Applies
- User asks to "test" a skill or rule
- User asks to "try out", "demo", or "show" a component or pattern
- User asks to build a sample page, chart, dashboard, or presentation to see how something looks
- User asks to create example data or slides
- Any file whose purpose is to validate or explore rather than to ship

## Where Files Go

```
examples/
├── pages/        ← sample pages and views
├── components/   ← demo components
├── data/         ← test data files
├── utils/        ← helper scripts for examples
└── root/         ← standalone HTML/CSS demos
```

## Examples

### ✅ GOOD — test file in examples/
User: "Test the dataviz color skill with a bar chart"
→ Create `examples/pages/BarChartTest.tsx` and `examples/pages/bar-chart-test.css`

### ✅ GOOD — demo data in examples/
User: "Create some sample slide data to try the presentation skill"
→ Create `examples/data/sampleSlides.ts`

### ❌ BAD — test file in src/
User: "Test the dataviz color skill with a bar chart"
→ Do NOT create `src/pages/BarChartTest.tsx`

## Why This Matters
`examples/` is listed in `.gitignore` and is never committed or pushed to the remote repository. `src/` is the core MDS model and is tracked by git. Mixing test files into `src/` pollutes the repo and confuses collaborators about what is core vs. experimental.

**The rule in one line:** build a skill in `src/`, test a skill in `examples/`.
