# Example and Test Files Go in `examples/` — NEVER in `src/`

## Critical Rule
When creating files to **test, demonstrate, or experiment with** a skill or component, always place them in the `examples/` folder. **Never create test or demo files anywhere inside `src/`**, including `src/pages/`, `src/components/`, or `src/data/`.

## Why `src/` is Off-Limits for Examples
`src/` is tracked by git and pushed to the shared repository. Any file created there — even temporarily — risks being committed and shared with the whole team. `examples/` is gitignored and permanently local only.

## Prohibited Locations for Test/Demo Files

```
❌ src/pages/MyTestPage.tsx
❌ src/pages/MyTestPage.css
❌ src/components/TestChart.tsx
❌ src/data/testData.ts
```

## Correct Locations

```
✅ examples/pages/MyTestPage.tsx
✅ examples/pages/MyTestPage.css
✅ examples/components/TestChart.tsx
✅ examples/data/testData.ts
```

## When This Applies
- User asks to "test" a skill or rule
- User asks to "try out", "demo", or "show" a component or pattern
- User asks to build a sample page, chart, dashboard, or presentation
- User asks to create example data or slides
- Any file whose purpose is to validate or explore rather than to ship

## Full Folder Map

```
examples/
├── pages/        ← sample pages and views
├── components/   ← demo components
├── data/         ← test data files
├── utils/        ← helper scripts for examples
└── root/         ← standalone HTML/CSS demos

src/              ← core MDS model only, always tracked by git
├── ui/           ← reusable MDS components
├── styles/mds/   ← design tokens
├── pages/        ← CORE pages only (Dashboard, LandingPage)
└── components/   ← CORE components only (Navigation)
```

## Examples

### ✅ GOOD
User: "Test the dataviz color skill with a bar chart"
→ Create `examples/pages/BarChartTest.tsx` and `examples/pages/bar-chart-test.css`

User: "Create some sample slide data to try the presentation skill"
→ Create `examples/data/sampleSlides.ts`

User: "Show me what the analytics dashboard looks like"
→ Create `examples/pages/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`

### ❌ BAD — these will pollute the repo
User: "Test the dataviz color skill with a bar chart"
→ ~~`src/pages/BarChartTest.tsx`~~

User: "Show me what the analytics dashboard looks like"
→ ~~`src/pages/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`~~

## Also Update App.tsx and Navigation.tsx Carefully
If adding a test page to `examples/` that you want to view in the browser, import it using a relative path from `examples/` — and add a comment marking it as a local-only import:

```tsx
// LOCAL ONLY — not committed to repo
import { AnalyticsDashboard } from '../../examples/pages/AnalyticsDashboard'
```

Never import from `examples/` in a commit meant for the shared repo.

## The Rule in One Line
Build a skill in `src/`. Test a skill in `examples/`.
